# DAFNet: Dual-Attention Fusion Network for Alzheimer’s Disease Classification

This repository provides the official implementation of **DAFNet**, a robust dual-attention fusion framework for multi-class Alzheimer’s disease dementia detection using MRI images.

## 🔍 Overview
Early and accurate detection of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains challenging due to subtle and region-specific brain changes. DAFNet addresses these challenges by integrating:
- Multi-level feature fusion
- Dual attention mechanisms
- Deep learning–based MRI classification

The proposed framework effectively captures both fine-grained spatial details and high-level semantic representations.

## 🧠 Methodology
- Backbone CNN: MobileNetV2
- Multi-level feature extraction
- Dual-attention fusion (spatial + semantic)
- Multi-class classification of dementia stages
